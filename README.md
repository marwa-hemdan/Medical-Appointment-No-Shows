According to this dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments/data

Goal: Find what factors affect whether a patient shows up for their appointment.
Step 1: Clean the Data
I use filters and formulas to 
 Remove rows with Age < 0, Standardize column name, Convert "No-show" to 1/0.

Step 2: Use pivot tables to compare each column vs NoShow. Examples:
Rows: Gender, Age Group, Day of the Week
Values: NoShow (sum)

step 3: Spot Patterns and Ask Critical Questions
Are older people more likely to show up?
Do people with chronic diseases attend more?
Does sending an SMS actually help?
Could some trends be caused by hidden variables?

step 4: Visualize Key Findings
Bar charts (No-show % by age group, gender, SMS_Received)
Bar charts (No-show VS chronic diseases)

Step5: Summarize Insights
**********“Patients over 60 have lower no-show rates.”***********
When you group patients by age or age bands (0–18, 19–60, 60+), you'll see:
No-show rates tend to decrease as age increases.
Young adults and teenagers are more likely to miss appointments.
🧠 Interpretation:
Older patients may be more motivated due to chronic health conditions or discipline.
Younger patients may forget, deprioritize appointments, or rely on others (parents).

 
************SMS_received = 1 → no-show rate is not lower, sometimes slightly higher*************

🧠 Critical thinking:
This does not mean SMS reminders cause no-shows.
Possibility: clinics only send SMS to patients they expect might not come.
Or: patients may ignore the reminder or already decided not to attend.
***********************report***********
Based on the data, several key factors appear to influence whether patients show up for their medical appointments.

First, age plays a clear role — older patients tend to be more likely to attend. 
This could be because they’re more concerned about their health or have more experience managing appointments.
Similarly, patients with chronic conditions like hypertension or diabetes also have higher attendance rates, 
which suggests that ongoing health needs encourage follow-through.
We also noticed that the time between when an appointment is scheduled and when it actually takes place matters. 
Longer wait times seem to increase the chances of a no-show, possibly because people forget or their situation changes.
As for reminders, SMS messages didn’t seem to significantly reduce no-show rates in this dataset.
That doesn’t necessarily mean reminders aren’t helpful — 
it could be that the timing or content of the messages wasn’t effective, or that they were sent to the wrong group of patients.
Finally, there are clear differences between neighborhoods. 
Some areas consistently show higher no-show rates.
This may reflect deeper social factors like income, transportation access, or work flexibility — things not included in the dataset but likely to have an impact.
